# NYPD-Data

Dataset: [nypd-shootings.csv](https://github.com/shivenarya5/NYPD-Data/files/13386422/nypd-shootings.csv) (Shootings in New York from 2006-2021)

Dataset derived from (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/NYPD/fjn5-bxwg). Downloaded dataset then trimmed it to only include shooting incidents.

My project aims to analyze the NYPD shooting crime dataset to explore how crime intensity has evolved over the years in New York. 
This is a valuable endeavor, as understanding crime trends can inform policy-making and community safety initiatives.

Importance of the Question

Understanding the trend of shooting incidents over time is crucial for informing public safety strategies, law enforcement resource allocation, and community engagement initiatives. It also prompts further investigation into the underlying causes of these trends.

Analysis of the Visualization

Why a Line Graph?

A line graph was chosen to effectively represent the evolution of shooting incidents in New York over a 16-year period. Line graphs are excellent for showcasing trends and changes over time, allowing for easy observation of increases or decreases in incident frequency.

Interpretation and Insights

The graph illustrates a fluctuating trend, with a noticeable peak in 2006 followed by a general decline until 2017.
A significant surge is observed in 2020, which could be correlated with external factors (e.g., socio-economic changes, policy shifts). The continuation of this upward trend into 2021 is particularly noteworthy.
The visualization clearly communicates the dynamic nature of crime incidents in New York City over the years, providing a visual foundation for more in-depth analysis.

Why This Graph: The heat map effectively illustrates trends and patterns over time, highlighting variations in the intensity of shootings across different months and years. It's particularly useful for identifying seasonal or annual trends in the data.

Interpretations and Insights from the Heat Map

Analyzing the provided heat map directly, we observe distinct trends and variations in the number of shooting incidents across different months and years. From the data visualized in the heat map, certain months consistently exhibit higher numbers of shooting incidents compared to others. For instance, looking at the color intensities, the summer months (June, July, and August) across most years show darker shades, indicating a higher frequency of shootings. This pattern is particularly noticeable in years like 2006 and 2007, where the number of incidents in these months visibly surpasses other months. In contrast, the winter months (January, February, and December) generally display lighter colors, suggesting fewer shootings. This could be indicative of a seasonal trend where warmer months see increased outdoor activities leading to more conflicts. The heat map also sheds light on the yearly trends. For example, a comparison between earlier years like 2006-2008 and later years such as 2009-2011 reveals a change in the overall pattern of incidents. The intensity of colors in the later years across several months suggests either an increase in the total number of shootings or a spread in the months experiencing high incidents.

Why This Graph: The bar chart provides a clear and straightforward way to compare the frequency of incidents at different hours. It's ideal for highlighting the times when shootings are most and least frequent.

Interpretations and Insights from the Bar Chart

The bar chart depicting the frequency of shooting incidents by hour in New York City offers vital insights into the daily patterns of gun violence. A close examination of the graph reveals that certain hours, particularly late at night and early in the morning, witness a higher frequency of shootings. This trend might be associated with several factors, including the closing times of bars and nightclubs, the reduced presence of law enforcement during these hours, or the lower likelihood of witnesses being around. The heightened incidents during these hours could also be linked to activities related to illegal enterprises, which often operate under the cover of darkness. Conversely, the graph shows a significant drop in the number of incidents during the early morning hours, roughly from 4 AM to 7 AM. This decrease could be attributed to the reduced number of people outside during these hours. Understanding these patterns is crucial for law enforcement and city planners. It suggests that there could be a strategic benefit in reallocating resources and increasing patrols during the late-night and early-morning hours to deter potential shootings.
